when pushing an existing repository from the command line,
I often got the error messages

"error: src refspec master does not match any."
"error: failed to push some refs to https:// ~ "

I don't know why it happens.. anyway
the steps below worked pretty well for me

1. git add .
2. git fetch
3. git commit -m "Init"
4. git push -u origin master
